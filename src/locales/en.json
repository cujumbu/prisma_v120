  "warrantyFAQ": {
    "eligibilityQuestion": "What products are eligible for warranty cases?",
    "eligibilityAnswer": "All products purchased from our store are eligible for warranty cases within the specified warranty period. Please note that it typically doesn't include strap damage, bracelet damage, crown damage or glass damage, unless the issue appears immediately after you've received the product. It does not cover battery changes either, unless the battery issue occurs within 6 months of receiving the product. Any warranty claims that don't abide by this are subject to a handling and shipment fee of 300 DKK.",
    "processQuestion": "How long does the warranty case process take?",
    "processAnswer": "To maintain the validity of the product warranty, most brands require that their own service center handles all complaints. Some brands have centralized this service center for all of Europe, and therefore processing times can be up to 5-7 weeks due to transportation time. However, for many brands, it typically takes 1 to 2 weeks.",
    "timeframeQuestion": "How do I submit a warranty case?",
    "timeframeAnswer": "To submit a warranty case, fill out the form below with your order number, contact information, and a short but precise description of the issue. Make sure to include the address you want us to return the product to, as that might be different from what we have on file. Also, it's very important that you only send the watch and the warranty card, not the watch box it came with. If you send it in a box, we are not required to return it with the watch box. Be sure to protect the watch as much as possible, as you are legally responsible for the transportation to us."
  },
  "returnFAQ": {
    "eligibilityQuestion": "What is your return policy?",
    "eligibilityAnswer": "We accept returns within 30 days of purchase for most items. The item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging.",
    "processQuestion": "How do I initiate a return?",
    "processAnswer": "To initiate a return, fill out the form below with your order number, email, and reason for return. Once approved, we'll provide you with return shipping instructions.",
    "refundQuestion": "When will I receive my refund?",
    "refundAnswer": "Once we receive and inspect the returned item, we'll process your refund. It typically takes 5-10 business days for the refund to appear on your original payment method."
